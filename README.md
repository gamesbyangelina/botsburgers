# botsburgers

Hey! This is the source code to @botsburgers, a bot which posts Burger Of The Day style images as seen on Bob's Burgers!

A few notes:

+ I removed the character art I have from the bot, since I wanted to minimise cartoon assets in the repo.
+ I removed the font I use, since I can't remember what the license on it is.

I'm working on a full writeup of the bot for my blog. Even if you're not interested in the bot, you might like the following files:

* films.txt which has some popular films
* idioms.txt which has a list of semi-curated well-known phrases

Thanks for dropping by!
